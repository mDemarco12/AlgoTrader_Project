Personal Comment: I don\'92t consider myself much interesting in coding. For a while I hated it, I found it clunky and it didn\'92t respond at all compared things like AWS or ERP. But I am incredibly fascinated with finance and and currently research what it\'92s like to be a quant. Imagine that, I hate coding and now I want to be a quant haha. But this project taught me how badss it is to use python for research, backtesting, and model building. I thoroughly enjoyed this project, and I learned to not only love coding, but to apply for a good use. I may not be a quant yet, but this is a great start! Thanks for checking out my project. I will provide a start up guide in another text file. }
